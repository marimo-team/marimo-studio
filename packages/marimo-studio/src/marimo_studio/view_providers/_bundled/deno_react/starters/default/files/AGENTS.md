# React starter instructions

Follow the Marimo Studio skill for notebook ownership, projection selection,
view lifecycle, and validation. This file covers the React project supplied by
this starter.

## Project intent

Keep this section current with the user's audience, analytical goal, concrete
project details, aesthetic direction, interaction priorities, and approved
library or framework preferences. Preserve decisions that should guide later
agents.

## Use the supplied Studio integration

The target array mapped to `<marimo-cell>` in `src/App.tsx` starts with each
enabled notebook cell that may display output, including literal Markdown, in
document order. Edit that array and its surrounding JSX to keep, reorder, group,
or replace targets as the component design develops.

- `src/marimo-studio.d.ts` types the Studio custom elements and attributes for
  React. Keep the reference at the top of `src/App.tsx`. Extend application
  types in a separate declaration when the page introduces its own elements.
- `src/lib/use-marimo-value.ts` adapts an explicit `mo-value` host into React
  state. Keep the host in JSX so Studio can inspect and authorize its selector.

```tsx
import { type MarimoTable, useMarimoValue } from "./lib/use-marimo-value.ts";

type Row = { id: string; label: string };

const { hostRef, value: rows } = useMarimoValue<MarimoTable<Row>>("rows");

return (
  <section>
    <span ref={hostRef} hidden mo-value="rows" />
    <output>{rows?.numRows ?? 0}</output>
  </section>
);
```

Use the supplied declarations as the type contract. A custom-element type error
indicates a missing declaration reference or an invalid attribute.

Eager dataframes arrive as a shared `MarimoTable` backed by Flechette. Use
[https://github.com/uwdata/flechette](https://github.com/uwdata/flechette) as
the table API reference. Keep data columnar with `getChild()`, `select()`, and
`toColumns()`. Call `toArray()` when a component needs row objects.

Treat the table as immutable. `getMarimoDataSource(table)` returns its codec,
fingerprint, and shared Arrow IPC bytes. Copy the bytes before mutating them.

## Add dependencies

Use the Deno supplied by `marimo-studio[deno]` in the notebook's Python
environment so dependency updates and Studio builds use the same version.

Run from the view root so it updates `deno.json` and `deno.lock` together:

```console
uv run -- deno add --frozen=false --save-exact \
  npm:d3@7 \
  npm:@observablehq/plot@0.6 \
  npm:arquero@8 \
  jsr:@std/csv@1
```

Import the aliases written to `deno.json`:

```ts
import * as d3 from "d3";
import * as Plot from "@observablehq/plot";
import * as aq from "arquero";
import { parse as parseCsv } from "@std/csv";
```

Choose the packages the page actually needs. D3 and Observable Plot render
visualizations, Arquero transforms tabular data, and `@std/csv` parses CSV
through JSR. Deno also accepts registry package subpaths and explicit local
aliases when a package's documentation calls for them.

Keep `minimumDependencyAge` and the frozen lockfile policy intact. Commit both
`deno.json` and `deno.lock` after adding or changing a dependency. Use
`--frozen=false` for that intentional update. Normal builds remain frozen.

## Work within the React project

- Build with the React 19 and Deno versions pinned in `deno.json` and
  `deno.lock`.
- Keep the application entry in `src/main.tsx` and compose page components from
  `src/App.tsx` or focused modules under `src/`.
- Keep page styles in `src/style.css` or local CSS modules imported by the
  component that owns them.
- Put static files under `public/` and reference them from the page. The
  provider copies that directory into the built artifact.
- Prefer React state and browser APIs already available in the project.

Studio's React build runs type checking before bundling. Treat that build as the
acceptance boundary for declarations, imports, and packaged assets.

## Preserve notebook traceability

Prefer `mo-value` for values, `marimo-output` for rich values, and `marimo-cell`
for native cell output. Keep analytical computation in the notebook. When custom
JavaScript rendering is necessary, every result must declare its kernel inputs:

- Place hidden `mo-value` hosts directly inside the result, or use
  `data-marimo-lens-inputs="rows-data summary-data"` to reference projection
  hosts by unique, stable HTML IDs in the same document. Include every input,
  including shared inputs used through JS transforms. References must point
  directly to mounted `mo-value`, `marimo-output`, or `marimo-cell` hosts.
  Missing or duplicate IDs make the result unavailable to Lens. Never fabricate
  runtime metadata.
- Annotate individual metrics, rows, charts, and report pages. Prefer narrow
  selectors such as `summary.events`. Bind dynamic selectors and source IDs to
  the state that renders the result. Use `data-marimo-allow="*"` for selectors
  the provider cannot bound at build time. Unbounded selectors require Python or
  Browser runtime (`--runtime wasm` for export). Prepared exports need finite
  authored targets.
- Link browser-only aggregates to their actual kernel inputs and label the
  browser calculation. Canvas and PDF picking is limited to the chart or page
  unless the renderer supplies finer DOM targets.
- Set `aria-busy="true"` during asynchronous rendering and clear it on
  completion. Verify selection and producer context after data updates. These
  links declare dependencies, not automatic JS dataflow or historical values.
- Studio supplies native projection labels. Give custom regions a
  `data-marimo-lens-label` and optional `data-marimo-lens-detail`. Display text
  supplements the source links that connect results to the analytical graph.

## Maintain project ignore rules

You own this view project's `.gitignore`. When adding libraries, extensions, or
build tools, ignore their generated files, caches, local configuration, and
secrets. Keep authored source, dependency manifests, and lockfiles tracked.
Studio supplies workspace rules for its own artifacts and locks. Check
`git status --short --ignored` after running new tooling and update the view's
ignore rules before committing.
